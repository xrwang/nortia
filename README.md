Nortia is a skills & time sharing app for women.
She lives at:

For example, I am a graphic designer and I need someone to make a kickstarter video. I can login, list graphic design as my skill and then look up who has filmmaking skills.

I can email that person for an hour of their time. That person generates a unique code that I can then redeem for credits on Nortia.

Nortia was the Estruscan goddess of time.
