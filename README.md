# nortia

Nortia is a skills sharing app for women.

For example, I am a graphic designer and I need someone to make a kickstarter video. I can login, list graphic design as my skill and then look up who has filmmaking skills.

I can email that person for an hour of their time. That person generates a unique code that I can then redeem for credits on the site.
